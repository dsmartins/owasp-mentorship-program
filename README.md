# OWASP Mentorship Program

Welcome to the official OWASP Mentorship Program repository!  
This initiative connects experienced security professionals with mentees interested in learning and contributing to OWASP projects and the broader AppSec community.

## 🔍 Purpose
To empower and grow the next generation of security practitioners through guided, hands-on mentorship experiences within OWASP.

## 🎯 Objectives
- Bridge Skill Gaps: Support newcomers in learning AppSec through structured guidance.
- Empower Contribution: Encourage mentees to contribute to OWASP projects (e.g., Juice Shop, ZAP).
- Foster Community: Build stronger local and global OWASP communities.
- Develop Leaders: Grow future project leads, chapter leaders, and security professionals.
- Diversity & Inclusion: Ensure accessibility for mentees of all backgrounds.
